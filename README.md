# 📖 Project Name

## Analysis of Export Economy of Bangladesh

### About this project <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project a brief analysis has been done by our team in the export economy of Bangldesh for the past three decades. The data utilized for this project was collected from the website of [Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)](https://oec.world/) and [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/). The thorough investigation has been done with the help of several python libraries including `Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Plotly,` and `IneualiPy`. The detailed [project report](/report/Analysis%20of%20Export%20Economy%20of%20Bangldesh.pdf) and [presentation](/report/Exports%20of%20Bangladesh.pptx) are added to this repository for the understanding of our analysis and the outcome of the project.
